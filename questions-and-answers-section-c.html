(Note: PDF implies "within 7 days of closing" could mean "no later than 7 days before" or "within 7 days after" - common interpretation is prior notice or immediate after. However, the text says "must be received within 7 days of closing" which is ambiguous. Let's assume it means very close to the closing event itself or immediately after for the purpose of this question based on the phrasing "On closing day - OCP...will contact...to confirm whether it has officially closed.") *Correction: The PDF phrasing "Notice of Intent (must be received within 7 days of closing)" is unusual. Standard practice for *intent* is prior. However, if strictly following the text, it implies a very short window. A better interpretation for *intent* would be prior. For this question, let's assume the wording implies a post-closing confirmation or very near-term action.* Let's rephrase one correct option to be less ambiguous based on standard practice vs strict text interpretation.
            A more solid correct answer: File a "Pharmacy Closing Statement" with the OCP within 30 days of the pharmacy having closed.</div>
            <div class="choice-option" data-correct="true">All signs and symbols relating to the practice of pharmacy within or outside the premises must be removed.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The OCP will automatically contact the pharmacy on its expected closing day to confirm closure without prior notice from the pharmacy.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">All patient records must be destroyed securely on the day of closing.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The pharmacy must remain on the Public Register for at least 6 months after closing.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Unused drugs can be sold to the public at a discount on the final day of operation.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The "Notice of Intent" must be submitted at least 45 days before the proposed closing date.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The pharmacy owner must personally visit the OCP office to announce the closure.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The "Pharmacy Closing Statement" is optional if the pharmacy has no outstanding debts.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The OCP will conduct a final inspection on the closing day before the pharmacy can officially cease operations.</div>

    <!-- Re-evaluating jp_c_022 first correct option for clarity from PDF.
         The PDF says: "Submit a Notice of Intent (must be received within 7 days of closing)".
         And then: "On closing day - OCP Client Services will contact the pharmacy to confirm whether it has officially closed".
         And then: "File a Pharmacy Closing Statement within 30 days of closing".
         The "Notice of Intent" phrasing is tricky. Let's use the other two definite actions.

        <p class="question-text">If a pharmacist receives a verbal prescription, what are two important documentation practices mentioned in the text?</p>
        <div class="choices">
            <div class="choice-option" data-correct="true">The person receiving the verbal prescription (e.g., pharmacist, intern) must sign the written record of that verbal order.</div>
            <div class="choice-option" data-correct="true">It is good practice to document who was spoken with (e.g., name of the person calling from the prescriber's office, if not the prescriber themselves), especially since it may not always be the actual prescriber calling.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Verbal prescriptions do not need to be reduced to writing if they are for non-narcotic drugs.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Only the dispensing pharmacist needs to sign the record, not necessarily the person who took the verbal order.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The time of the call and the call duration must be meticulously logged for all verbal prescriptions.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">A call-back verification to the prescriber's office is mandatory for every verbal prescription received.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The patient's verbal consent to the medication must be recorded alongside the verbal prescription.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">If the call is recorded, a written transcription is not necessary.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The pharmacist can pre-sign blank prescription forms to expedite the documentation of verbal orders.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The unique identifier for a verbal prescription is the phone number it was received from.</div>
