        <p class="question-text">Regarding Unscheduled (Schedule U) drugs in Ontario, identify two correct characteristics.</p>
        <div class="choices">
            <div class="choice-option" data-correct="true">They can be sold in any retail outlet in the province of Ontario, such as a gas station or convenience store, without professional supervision.</div>
            <div class="choice-option" data-correct="true">Adequate information, including labeling, is considered available for the patient to make a safe and effective choice without needing direct advice from a healthcare professional.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Schedule U drugs are still legally defined as "drugs" and therefore require a pharmacist to be on the premises for their sale, even in non-pharmacy retail outlets.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">All vitamin and mineral supplements are automatically classified as Schedule U.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Schedule U drugs must possess either a DIN or NPN to be legally sold.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Pharmacists have no professional responsibility to answer patient questions about Schedule U drugs if purchased within a pharmacy.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Ibuprofen 400mg tablets in large package sizes (e.g., >18,000mg total) are typically Schedule U.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The primary factor for U scheduling is the drug's low cost, not its safety profile for self-selection.</div>

            <div class="choice-option">The NDSAC's recommendations are automatically binding federal law across Canada without provincial adoption.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The NDSAC primarily focuses on harmonizing the prices of drugs across provinces.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The NDSAC is a committee within Health Canada that directly creates federal drug schedules like the PDL.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Once NDSAC assigns a schedule, it cannot be changed or reviewed for at least five years.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The NDSAC's cascading model assesses drugs solely on their chemical composition, not on public risk.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Provinces like Ontario are mandated by federal law to consult NDSAC before making any changes to their local drug formularies.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The NDSAC determines if a drug requires a DIN or NPN.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The NDSAC process ensures that all drugs are eventually moved to Schedule U as more safety data becomes available.</div>

            <div class="choice-option">The NAPRA system completely nullified and replaced all aspects of the older federal F, G, and N schedules, making them legally irrelevant in Ontario.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Federal Schedule F (now PDL) exclusively determined prescription status, and NAPRA had no role in classifying drugs as prescription-only.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The existence of prior federal schedules meant that NAPRA's primary role was to de-schedule drugs to make more of them available over-the-counter.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Ontario chose not to adopt NAPRA because the federal F, G, and N schedules were deemed sufficient and more nationally consistent.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The "N" symbol on stock bottles (for Narcotics) is a NAPRA initiative, not related to the older federal Schedule N.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The federal schedules F, G, and N were primarily concerned with drug manufacturing standards, not conditions of sale, which was NAPRA's focus.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">Before NAPRA, there was no system for classifying non-prescription drugs in Ontario; all non-Schedule F drugs were effectively unscheduled.</div>
            <div class="choice-option">The NDSAC was originally formed to manage the federal F, G, and N schedules before transitioning to NAPRA.</div>
