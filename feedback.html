        <p class="feedback-text">Andres Bonifacio is known as the "Father of the Philippine Revolution" for founding the Katipunan. Emilio Aguinaldo became the first president of the First Philippine Republic. Jose Rizal, while a national hero and an inspiration for the revolution through his writings, was executed before the main military phase and did not lead troops. Apolinario Mabini was the "Brains of the Revolution" and later of Aguinaldo's government. Antonio Luna was a brilliant and fiery general.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Aftermath of the Spanish-American War</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Treaty of Paris (1898) formally ended the Spanish-American War. Spain ceded the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico to the United States. This was not accepted by Filipino revolutionaries who had declared independence, leading directly to the Philippine-American War (1899-1902) as the U.S. sought to assert its control.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Pre-Colonial Societies</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Philippine archipelago was home to various developed societies before Spanish colonization.

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Japanese Occupation (WWII)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Japanese occupation (1942-1945) was a brutal period. The Bataan Death March involved the forcible transfer of American and Filipino prisoners of war, resulting in many deaths. The Battle of Leyte Gulf (1944) was a decisive naval battle that crippled the Japanese Navy and marked the beginning of the Allied liberation of the Philippines. The Hukbalahap (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon) was a major communist-led guerrilla army that fought against the Japanese.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Propagandists of the Late 19th Century</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Propaganda Movement was a period of peaceful reform efforts by Filipino expatriates in Spain. Jose Rizal (author of Noli Me Tángere and El Filibusterismo), Marcelo H. del Pilar (editor of La Solidaridad), and Graciano López Jaena (first editor of La Solidaridad) were its leading figures. They advocated for assimilation, representation in the Spanish Cortes, and reforms in the colonial administration.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">La Liga Filipina</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">La Liga Filipina, founded by Rizal upon his return to the Philippines in 1892, was a civic society aiming for national unity, mutual aid, defense against injustice, promotion of education, agriculture, and commerce, and the study and application of reforms. It was a peaceful reformist organization, but its perceived threat led to Rizal's arrest and deportation, which in turn contributed to the formation of the more radical Katipunan.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Galleon Trade</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade (1565-1815) was a crucial trade route. Spanish galleons sailed between Manila in the Philippines (part of the Spanish East Indies) and Acapulco in Mexico (New Spain). Chinese goods (silk, porcelain, spices) were brought to Manila, then shipped to Acapulco in exchange for Mexican silver. This trade was a cornerstone of Spanish colonial income for centuries.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">National Symbols</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Philippine Eagle is the national bird, known for its majestic size and critically endangered status. The Sampaguita is the national flower, prized for its fragrance. Other official national symbols include Narra (national tree) and Arnis (national martial art and sport). While the carabao is a widely recognized symbol of Filipino hard work, it's not officially the national animal (that title belongs to the Philippine Eagle, though "national bird" is more common).</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Regarding the Carabao:</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The carabao is highly symbolic of Filipino agriculture and perseverance and is often unofficially considered a national animal. However, the Philippine Eagle is officially recognized as the national bird, and by extension, often referred to as the national animal in that context.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Commonwealth Period</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Commonwealth of the Philippines (1935-1946) was a transitional period during which the Philippines prepared for full independence from the United States, as mandated by the Tydings-McDuffie Act. Key developments included drafting a new constitution, establishing a Filipino-led government with Manuel L. Quezon as president, and granting women's suffrage in 1937. This period was interrupted by the Japanese occupation during World War II.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Resistance to Spanish Colonization</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Resistance to Spanish rule was present throughout the colonial period. Lapu-Lapu's victory in Mactan (1521) was an early example. Various revolts, like Tamblot's in Bohol (1621-1622) which was religiously motivated, and the uprisings led by Diego Silang and Gabriela Silang in Ilocos (1762-1763), demonstrated continued opposition. Muslim sultanates in the south, like the Sultanate of Sulu and Maguindanao (led by figures like Sultan Kudarat), also maintained their independence for a long time through armed struggle.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Suez Canal's Impact</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 drastically reduced travel time between Europe and Asia, including the Philippines. This facilitated quicker communication and trade. More significantly, it allowed for a greater influx of liberal ideas from Europe and made it easier for affluent Filipinos (Ilustrados) to travel and study in Europe, where they were exposed to enlightenment ideals, contributing to the rise of Filipino nationalism and the Propaganda Movement.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Cry of Pugad Lawin/Balintawak</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The "Cry" (Sigaw) refers to the historic event where members of the Katipunan, led by Andres Bonifacio, tore up their cedulas (community tax certificates) as a symbol of defiance against Spanish rule. This event, dated around August 23-26, 1896, is widely considered the beginning of the Philippine Revolution against Spain.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Acts During American Colonial Period</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Philippine Bill of 1902 (Cooper Act) provided for the creation of a Philippine Assembly after peace was established. The Jones Law of 1916 (Philippine Autonomy Act) promised eventual independence and established a bicameral Philippine Legislature. The Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934 (Philippine Independence Act) set a 10-year transition period (the Commonwealth) leading to full independence.</p>

        <h4 class="feedback-title">Martial Law under Marcos</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law in 1972, officially lifting it in 1981, though he retained extensive powers. This period was characterized by the curtailment of civil liberties, censorship of the press, the abolition of Congress (replaced by the Batasang Pambansa), widespread human rights abuses by the military and police, and the rise of crony capitalism. Insurgencies by groups like the New People's Army (NPA) and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) also intensified during this time.</p>
