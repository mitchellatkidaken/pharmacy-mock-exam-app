        <h4 class="feedback-title">Drug and Pharmacies Regulation Act (DPRA) Overview</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The DPRA is key provincial legislation in Ontario. It governs the operation of pharmacies, including aspects like ownership, accreditation, opening, and closing procedures. It also regulates the sale of drugs within the province. A significant point is DPRA Section 118, which states that the DPRA's provisions regarding pharmacy operations do not apply to hospital pharmacies; these are instead governed by the Public Hospitals Act. The DPRA works in conjunction with other legislation and its own regulations, which provide more detailed rules on how the Act's provisions should be implemented.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_002">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">DPRA Definitions</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The DPRA defines several crucial terms for pharmacy practice in Ontario. A "Pharmacist" is a person who is registered with, and holds a license from, the Ontario College of Pharmacists (OCP). A "Prescription" is defined as a direction given by an authorized "Prescriber" (a healthcare professional recognized under DPRA with prescribing rights within their scope, e.g., physicians, dentists, nurse practitioners, optometrists for certain drugs) for a specific item, typically a drug or device, to be dispensed for a named individual patient following a diagnosis or assessment.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_002" data-option-text="The definition of &quot;Prescriber&quot; in the DPRA is identical to the definition in the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA).">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Regarding "Prescriber" Definition: DPRA vs. CDSA</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">This is incorrect. The DPRA has a broader list of recognized prescribers for general medications within Ontario (e.g., includes chiropodists, optometrists, midwives for their specific lists). The federal CDSA, which governs narcotics and controlled substances, has a more restricted definition of "practitioner" authorized to prescribe these specific substances (typically physicians, dentists, veterinarians, and in some cases, nurse practitioners with extended class registration and specific authorities).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_003">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Requirements for Written Prescriptions (General)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">A written prescription in Ontario must meet several fundamental requirements to be valid. Crucially, it must bear the original, unique signature of the prescriber; rubber stamps or pre-signed forms are not acceptable. Each prescription must be signed individually. It must also clearly indicate the date on which the prescription was written by the prescriber. While other information like patient name, drug details, and directions are also mandatory, the signature and date are foundational elements of authenticity and validity. Electronic or emailed prescriptions generally require specific conditions or systems to be considered valid, distinct from a simple scanned image of a written Rx.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_004">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">DPRA Section 156: Record of Dispensing</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When a drug is dispensed, DPRA Section 156 mandates that specific information be recorded. This includes identifying the manufacturer of the actual drug product that was dispensed (e.g., Apotex, Teva, Pfizer). Additionally, the signature of the person who performed the dispensing (typically the pharmacist) must be recorded. If the prescription was received verbally, the signature of the person who took down that verbal order (if different from the dispenser) must also be recorded. This ensures accountability and traceability for the dispensed medication.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_004" data-option-text="The Drug Identification Number (DIN) of the drug dispensed.">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Regarding DIN on Dispensing Record:</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">While the DIN is a good identifier and is typically included on pharmacy hardcopies generated by software, the text for DPRA Section 156 (as summarized in the PDF) specifically lists "identity of the manufacturer" and does not explicitly list DIN as a mandatory recorded item *under this specific section's list*. However, good practice and other labelling/record requirements often lead to its inclusion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_005">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Retention of Scanned Electronic Records (DPRA Regulations)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Ontario regulations under the DPRA have specific requirements for retaining scanned electronic copies of prescriptions and other patient care documents. These scanned copies must be kept for at least 10 years from the date of the last recorded professional pharmacy service provided to that patient. If the patient was under 18 at the time of the last service, the records must be kept until 10 years after the day the patient reached (or would have reached) the age of 18, if this period is longer. These records must be readily retrievable and stored securely to protect patient confidentiality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_006">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Record-Keeping for Remote Dispensing Locations (RDLs)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">In addition to standard pharmacy record-keeping, Remote Dispensing Locations (RDLs) have specific additional documentation requirements. These include maintaining a record of all testing performed on any automated pharmacy system before it is first used at the RDL, as well as records of all on-site inspections of the RDL. Furthermore, RDLs must keep a detailed log of all technical malfunctions that occur with their automated systems, noting the cause of the malfunction, how long the system was down, and the corrective actions taken to repair it. This ensures accountability and safety in these automated environments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_007">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Pharmacy Information on Dispensed Drug Labels (DPRA S.156)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When a drug is dispensed, the label on the container must include specific information about the pharmacy. As per DPRA Section 156, this includes the name and address of the pharmacy where the prescription was dispensed. The text also indicates that the phone number of the pharmacy is required on the label (example label shows it). This information allows patients and other healthcare providers to easily identify and contact the dispensing pharmacy if needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_008">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Labelling for Compliance Packs (Blister Packs)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Compliance packaging requires specific labelling to ensure patient safety and accurate medication administration. In addition to standard label information, each individual drug within the pack must be labelled with an identifier or descriptor. This descriptor should include details such as the drug's shape, colour, relative size, and any unique markings (e.g., imprints) on the tablet or capsule. Furthermore, it's good practice and often policy to label each drug with its generic name for clarity. PRN medications are generally dispensed separately, not in compliance packs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_009">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">DPRA Section 150: Misrepresentation</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">DPRA Section 150 prohibits misrepresentation in the sale of drugs. This includes selling a drug under the pretense that it contains a substance it does not actually contain. It also means that if a pharmacy dispenses a generic product different from what might be implied by the label (e.g., if the label said "Apotex-Clarithromycin" but the vial contained "Teva-Clarithromycin" and the label wasn't updated to reflect the actual manufacturer dispensed), it would be a violation. The label must accurately reflect the dispensed product. Failing to identify ingredients in a compounded preparation would also be a form of misrepresentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_010">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Exemptions for Child-Resistant Packages (CRPs)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">While the default is to dispense drugs in child-resistant packages (CRPs), DPRA Regulations provide exemptions. A pharmacist is exempt if the prescriber specifically directs on the prescription that a non-CRP be used. Another exemption occurs if, in the pharmacist's professional judgment, a CRP is unsuitable due to the physical form of the drug itself (e.g., some medications like nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may come in original glass packaging that shouldn't be altered, or some inhalers/creams are not amenable to CRPs). Patient requests for non-CRPs (which must be documented) are also a common exemption.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_011">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Patient's Right to a Copy of Prescription (DPRA S.157)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Under DPRA Section 157, a patient is generally entitled to receive a copy of their original prescription if they request it from the pharmacy (unless the prescriber has specifically directed otherwise, which is rare). When providing this copy, the pharmacist has an obligation to clearly mark it as a "COPY." This marking is crucial to prevent the copy from being mistaken for a new, valid prescription that could be filled again improperly at another pharmacy. A copy does not carry authority for new fillings or refills.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_012">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Non-Transferable Prescriptions in Ontario (DPRA Reg. S.43)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Ontario regulations (DPRA, Part VI of the Regulations, Section 43) strictly prohibit the transfer of certain types of prescriptions between pharmacies. Specifically, prescriptions for Narcotics (Schedule N medications under federal law) and Controlled Drugs (Schedule G medications under federal law) CANNOT be transferred. This prohibition applies even if there are refills remaining or if the prescription is a part-fill. Targeted substances have different rules (can be transferred once).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_013">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Transferring Prescriptions for Targeted Substances</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Prescriptions for targeted substances (e.g., benzodiazepines like lorazepam, clonazepam, diazepam) have specific transfer rules in Ontario. Such a prescription can be transferred only ONCE from the pharmacy that originally received it (Pharmacy A) to another pharmacy (Pharmacy B). Once Pharmacy B has received the transfer, it cannot then transfer any remaining refills to a third pharmacy (Pharmacy C). Additionally, these prescriptions (and any refills on them) are only valid for dispensing up to 12 months from the date the ORIGINAL prescription was WRITTEN by the prescriber, not from when it was first filled or transferred.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_014">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Information Provided by Originating Pharmacy During Transfer</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When a transferable prescription is being transferred from an originating pharmacy to a receiving pharmacy, the originating pharmacy must provide comprehensive information. This includes the date the prescription was first filled, and if applicable, the date of the last refill dispensed. It's also mandatory to communicate the total quantity of the drug that still remains to be dispensed, encompassing any authorized refills. Other required details include patient and prescriber information, drug details, directions, original Rx number, and the name of the member responsible for the transfer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_015">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Actions at Originating Pharmacy After a Transfer</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Once a prescription has been successfully transferred out to another pharmacy, the originating pharmacy is no longer authorized to fill that prescription or any of its remaining refills. They must also create a record of the transfer. This record must include the date the transfer occurred, the identification (name and address) of the pharmacy to which the prescription was transferred, and the name of the member (pharmacist) at the originating pharmacy who was responsible for conducting the transfer. If the transfer was done verbally, the name of the person at the receiving pharmacy who took the transfer should also be recorded.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_016">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Filling Out-of-Province (Canadian) Prescriptions (DPRA S.152)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Pharmacists in Ontario are permitted to fill prescriptions that originate from other Canadian provinces or territories. However, DPRA Section 152 requires the pharmacist to exercise their professional judgment in such cases. They must assess whether, in their professional opinion, the patient has a medical need for the drug. It's crucial to note that prescriptions from outside of Canada (e.g., from American or other international prescribers) CANNOT be filled in Ontario pharmacies. The pharmacist must also ensure the out-of-province prescriber is appropriately licensed in their jurisdiction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_017">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Requirements for Mailing/Delivery of Prescribed Drugs</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When mailing or delivering prescribed Schedule I drugs to a patient in Ontario, specific requirements must be met to ensure safety and accountability. The delivery method chosen must be traceable and auditable, allowing the pharmacy to confirm its path and receipt (e.g., registered mail, reputable courier with tracking). Furthermore, upon delivery, a receipt for the drug must be obtained, signed by either the patient themselves or by an authorized agent acting on the patient's behalf. This confirms the medication reached the intended recipient or their representative.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_018">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Pharmacist Refill Authorization (Renewal/Extension - DPRA Reg. 42)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Ontario pharmacists have the authority to renew or extend prescriptions for certain chronic conditions under specific circumstances (DPRA Regulation 42). This can only be considered if the patient has a previously diagnosed chronic and long-term condition and has been tolerating the medication without serious adverse effects. A key limitation is that the total quantity of the drug dispensed under such a pharmacist-authorized refill cannot exceed the amount that was previously prescribed by the doctor (including any original refills on that Rx), OR a 6-month supply, whichever of these two quantities is less. This authority does not apply to narcotics or controlled drugs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_019">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Documentation/Notification for Pharmacist-Renewed/Adapted Prescriptions</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When a pharmacist exercises their authority to renew or adapt a prescription, specific documentation and notification steps are mandatory. The pharmacist must meticulously document their rationale for making the decision to renew or adapt the prescription, and this documentation must be part of the patient's record and be easily retrievable. Additionally, the pharmacist is required to notify the original prescriber of the medication (and also the patient's primary healthcare provider, if this person is known and is different from the original prescriber) about the renewal or adaptation they have performed. This ensures continuity of care and keeps all relevant healthcare providers informed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_020">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Pharmacist Responsibilities in Compounding</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Compounding requires specialized knowledge and facilities. Pharmacists are responsible for ensuring that any compounded products are prepared in a non-contaminated environment and are free of particulate matter to maintain sterility or cleanliness as appropriate. They must also ensure they have access to contemporary and suitable equipment for the type of compounding being done and must use quality ingredients from reputable sources to ensure the safety and efficacy of the final preparation. Adherence to established health, safety, and environmental practices is also crucial.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_021">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Labelling Requirements for Compounded Preparations</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Labels for extemporaneously compounded preparations in Ontario must adhere to both federal and provincial requirements. Key information includes a clear listing of all active ingredients along with their respective concentrations or strengths. The label should also provide an estimated expiry date or a "best before date" (often referred to as a Beyond-Use Date or BUD), which is determined based on the stability of the ingredients and preparation. Appropriate storage instructions (e.g., "Refrigerate," "Protect from light") are also essential if applicable to maintain the product's integrity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_022_revised">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Mandatory Steps When Closing a Pharmacy Permanently</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When an Ontario pharmacy closes permanently, several steps are mandated by the DPRA and OCP. The pharmacy must file a "Pharmacy Closing Statement" with the OCP within 30 days of its official closing date. This statement provides final details about the closure. Another crucial requirement is that all signs and symbols that relate to the practice of pharmacy (such as the College's Point of Care symbol, pharmacy name signs, etc.) must be removed from both the inside and outside of the premises to avoid misleading the public. Proper disposal of drugs and management of patient records according to regulations are also key obligations.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_022_revised" data-option-text="Disposing of drugs must be done according to law, and written information about this disposal must be submitted to the Registrar.">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Regarding Drug Disposal on Closure:</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">This is indeed a critical step. The PDF states: "Must remove and dispose of all drugs according to law, and submit in writing to the Registrar such information." This makes it a strong correct answer alongside the Pharmacy Closing Statement and removal of signs.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_023">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Application Requirements for Opening a New Pharmacy</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">To open a new pharmacy in Ontario, an Application for Certificate of Accreditation must be submitted to the OCP. This application should be filed at least 45 days before the pharmacy's proposed opening date. A critical component of this application is a detailed floor plan of the proposed pharmacy premises. This floor plan must include the dimensions of the total area, the dimensions of the dispensary, the specific location of the two required sinks within the dispensary, and the location of an acoustically private patient consultation area.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_024">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Dispensing "Logged Prescriptions"</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When a patient requests that a previously "logged" prescription be dispensed, a specific checking process is required. A new hardcopy (dispensing record) is generated for this current dispensing event. Crucially, this newly generated hardcopy must be meticulously checked for accuracy against the ORIGINAL prescription document that was initially logged, not just against the hardcopy that was generated at the time of logging. This ensures that the dispensing is based on the authentic, original prescriber's order and helps catch any transcription errors that might have occurred during the initial logging process.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_024" data-option-text="The process for dispensing a logged prescription is identical to dispensing a simple refill.">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Logged Rx vs. Refill Process:</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The PDF explicitly states: "Process for filling a refill and logged prescription are not the same!" The key difference is the check against the original Rx for logged prescriptions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_025">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Recognized "Prescribers" under DPRA</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Drug and Pharmacies Regulation Act (DPRA) in Ontario defines specific healthcare professionals as "Prescribers," authorizing them to issue prescriptions within their defined scopes of practice. This list includes physicians, dentists, veterinarians (for animal use), nurse practitioners (RN(EC)s), optometrists (for specified drugs), chiropodists (DCh) / podiatrists (DPM), and midwives (for specified drugs related to their practice). Each has a defined formulary or scope they can prescribe from.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_026">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Prescribers of Narcotics/Controlled Substances (CDSA vs. DPRA)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) has a more restricted definition of "practitioner" authorized to prescribe narcotics and controlled substances compared to the broader list of "prescribers" under Ontario's DPRA for general medications. Under the CDSA, typically only physicians (MDs), dentists (DDS/DMD), and veterinarians (DVMs, for animal use only) have the broad authority to prescribe these substances. While some other practitioners like specially authorized Nurse Practitioners might have limited authority for certain CDSA drugs under specific conditions/regulations, the core group is physicians, dentists, and vets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_027">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Difference Between an "Act" and "Regulations"</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">In Canadian law, an "Act" (also called a statute) is a primary piece of legislation passed by a legislative body (e.g., provincial parliament). It sets out the broad framework, principles, and "what is to be done" or prohibited. "Regulations" are subordinate legislation made under the authority of an Act. They provide the specific, detailed rules on "how" the provisions of the Act are to be implemented and followed. Acts are more difficult and time-consuming to change (requiring the full legislative process), whereas regulations can often be amended more easily by the body to whom the Act delegates that authority (e.g., a ministry or regulatory college like OCP, subject to government approval).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_028">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Implications of DPRA Section 118 (Hospital Pharmacy Exemption)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">DPRA Section 118 states that the DPRA (which governs community pharmacies) does not apply to hospital pharmacies (which are governed by the Public Hospitals Act). However, this section also has implications for practitioners outside of hospitals. It allows certain practitioners who possess the "Controlled Act of dispensing" (such as physicians, dentists, and veterinarians) to dispense medications directly to their own patients from their private practices or clinics. While the OCP may not inspect these specific dispensing activities (as their own regulatory bodies would oversee their practice), these dispensing practitioners are still obligated to follow all other relevant federal and provincial laws and regulations pertaining to drug dispensing (e.g., labelling, record-keeping, appropriate storage, CDSA rules if applicable).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_029">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Requirement for Unique, Handwritten Signatures on Prescriptions</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The requirement for a unique, handwritten (non-stamped) signature from the prescriber on each prescription serves several important purposes. Primarily, it acts as a measure of authenticity, making the prescription harder to forge or fraudulently duplicate compared to a rubber stamp or a simple mark. It also signifies the prescriber's personal authorization and acceptance of professional responsibility for that specific medication order for that patient at that particular time. This helps ensure accountability in the prescribing process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_c_030">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Documenting Verbal Prescriptions</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When a verbal prescription is received (where permissible), proper documentation is crucial. The person who receives the verbal order (e.g., pharmacist, intern under supervision) must reduce it to writing and then sign that written record. It is also considered good practice, and often essential for clarity and accountability, to document exactly who was spoken with from the prescriber's office if the call did not come directly from the prescriber themselves (e.g., if a nurse or office assistant relayed the order under the prescriber's direction). This helps in case of any future queries or discrepancies.</p>
