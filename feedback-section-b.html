    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_001">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Characteristics of a "Straight Narcotic"</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">A "Straight Narcotic" under the Narcotic Control Regulations typically refers to a single narcotic ingredient or a preparation containing multiple narcotic ingredients. It can also be a narcotic compounded with one non-narcotic ingredient or one of the "5 Narcotics" (Hydrocodone, Morphine, Oxycodone, Pentazocine, Diacetylmorphine). Crucially, Straight Narcotics CANNOT be prescribed verbally; a written, signed prescription is mandatory. They are also not transferable between pharmacies, and refills are not permitted (though part-fills on a single prescription are).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_002">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">"Verbal Prescription Narcotics"</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">"Verbal Prescription Narcotics" are specific combinations that can be prescribed verbally. They must contain only ONE narcotic drug AND two or more other non-narcotic medicinal ingredients in recognized therapeutic doses. Importantly, these combinations CANNOT contain any of the "5 Narcotics" (Hydrocodone, Morphine, Oxycodone, Pentazocine, Diacetylmorphine) and must NOT be for parenteral (injectable) use. Examples include Tylenol #3 or Dimetapp C. Refills are not allowed on verbal prescriptions for these, though part-fills are.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_003">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">"Exempted Codeine Preparations"</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Exempted Codeine Preparations are non-prescription products (NAPRA Schedule II, also often Schedule N federally) containing low doses of codeine. They can have a maximum of 8mg of codeine per solid dosage unit (tablet/capsule) or 20mg of codeine per 30mL of liquid. They must also contain at least two other non-narcotic medicinal ingredients in therapeutic doses. Due to their Schedule II status, they cannot be visibly displayed in the pharmacy and must be requested by the patient, with pharmacist intervention required at the point of sale. A warning label regarding use in children is mandatory.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_003" data-option-text="Tylenol #3 is an example of an Exempted Codeine Preparation.">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Regarding Tylenol #3:</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Tylenol #3 (which contains 30mg of codeine per tablet) is a "Verbal Prescription Narcotic" (and also a prescription narcotic if written), not an Exempted Codeine Preparation. Exempted preparations have much lower codeine limits (e.g., 8mg/tablet like Tylenol #1).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_004">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">The "5 Narcotics" and Verbal Prescriptions</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The "5 Narcotics" that make a combination product ineligible to be a "Verbal Prescription Narcotic" are: Hydrocodone, Morphine, Oxycodone, Pentazocine, and Diacetylmorphine (Heroin). If a combination product contains any of these, even with other ingredients, it cannot be prescribed verbally as a "Verbal Prescription Narcotic" and would fall under stricter prescribing rules (likely requiring a written prescription as a "Straight Narcotic" or other controlled substance category).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_005">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Mandatory Prescription Requirements (Narcotics/Controlled)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">All prescriptions, especially for narcotics and controlled drugs, have specific mandatory components. These include the full name and address of the patient, and the name, strength (if applicable), quantity, and dosage form of the drug being prescribed. The prescriber's name, address, and signature are also essential, along with the date the prescription was written. For monitored drugs under NSAA, patient and prescriber identifiers are also key.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_006">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Refills for Narcotics, Controlled Drugs, and Benzodiazepines</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Refill regulations vary significantly:
        <br>- **Narcotics:** NO refills are permitted. Part-fills (dispensing a total prescribed quantity in divided portions) are allowed if specified by the prescriber.
        <br>- **Controlled Drugs Part I:** May be refilled if the prescriber has indicated in writing (or faxed) the number of refills and dates/intervals. Verbal prescriptions for Part I CD can be part-filled but not refilled.
        <br>- **Controlled Drugs Part II & III (plus preparations):** Refills are permitted for written or verbal prescriptions if authorized by the prescriber with number and dates/intervals.
        <br>- **Benzodiazepines & Targeted Substances:** Refills are permitted if specified. Prescriptions for these are valid for a maximum of 1 year from the date the prescription was WRITTEN by the prescriber.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_007">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Prescription Transfers for Controlled Substances</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Transfer rules are strict:
        <br>- **Narcotics:** NO transfers are permitted. This includes part-fills and logged prescriptions.
        <br>- **Controlled Drugs (Part I, II, III):** NO transfers are permitted. This includes part-fills and logged prescriptions.
        <br>- **Benzodiazepines & Targeted Substances:** These prescriptions may be transferred ONCE ONLY from the original pharmacy to another pharmacy. The receiving pharmacy cannot then transfer it further.
        The one-year validity from the date written also applies to transferred prescriptions for targeted substances.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_008">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Record-Keeping for Sales of Narcotics/Controlled Drugs</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Pharmacies must maintain detailed sales records for Narcotics and for Controlled Drugs Part I. These records can be kept in a dedicated Narcotic and Controlled Drug Register or in a compliant computer system, provided that a printout of the records can be readily obtained upon request or is available on the premises for inspection. Sales records are not explicitly required by these regulations for Controlled Drugs Part II or III, or for benzodiazepines/targeted substances (though dispensing records are always kept as per DPRA).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_009">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Reporting Loss or Theft of Narcotics</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Upon discovery of any loss or theft of a narcotic substance, a pharmacist has a mandatory duty to report it to Health Canada's Office of Controlled Substances. This report must be made within 10 days of the discovery. "Discovery" is the key timing element. This applies to any loss, including from inventory shortages, spillage (if significant and unrecoverable), breakage, theft, or forgeries (even if the forged prescription was not filled, as it represents an attempted diversion/loss). Pharmacies must also take all reasonable steps to protect these substances against loss or theft.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_010">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Destruction of Narcotics and Controlled Drugs</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The destruction of narcotics and most controlled drugs (e.g., Part I) requires prior written authorization from Health Canada's Office of Controlled Substances. The request must detail the drugs to be destroyed (name, strength, quantity). The actual destruction process should render the drugs unusable (alter and denature) and must be witnessed by another authorized health professional (e.g., another pharmacist, technician, practitioner), with a joint statement signed. Benzodiazepines and targeted substances do not require prior Health Canada authorization for destruction, but a detailed record of their destruction, including witnessing, must still be maintained.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_011">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Dispensing Methadone: Pharmacy Requirements</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Pharmacies dispensing methadone (for MMT or pain) must adhere to strict OCP policies and federal regulations. Key requirements include:
        <br>1. Notifying the OCP within 7 days of starting to dispense methadone, and keeping the OCP updated on operational status (e.g., accepting new patients, names of trained pharmacists, hours).
        <br>2. Ensuring appropriate staff training: the designated manager within 6 months of starting methadone practice, and at least one staff pharmacist within a year. Training (e.g., CAMH, OPA programs) must be updated at least every 5 years.
        <br>3. Verifying that the prescribing physician holds a valid federal exemption (CDSA Section 56) or CPSO authorization for prescribing methadone for the specific indication (MMT or pain).
        <br>4. Adhering to all relevant guidelines (e.g., CAMH for MMT) regarding preparation, dispensing, documentation, and patient agreements.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_012">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Preparation of Methadone Final Dosage Form for MMT</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Guidelines (like CAMH) for preparing methadone for MMT specify that the daily dose must be diluted, typically in about 100mL of a palatable vehicle that does not lend itself to injection (e.g., orange-flavoured Tang). This dilution helps prevent diversion for injection. Additionally, all methadone doses dispensed must be in bottles with child-proof safety caps due to the high risk of accidental ingestion by children, which can be fatal. Accurate measurement using tools like a measuring pump is crucial.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_013">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Dispenser Requirements under NSAA (Narcotic Safety and Awareness Act)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When dispensing a "monitored drug" under Ontario's NSAA, the dispenser (pharmacist/pharmacy) has several obligations. They must ensure that patient identity verification requirements are met before dispensing. This involves recording the patient's identifying number (from an approved ID type) and the type of ID used; this record is kept with the prescription record, not on the prescription itself. If an agent (someone other than the patient) picks up the prescription, the dispenser must record the name, address, identifying number, and type of ID for that agent as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_014">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Approved Forms of ID under NSAA</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The NSAA regulations specify types of identification that are acceptable for verifying a patient's identity when dispensing monitored drugs. The list (which can be updated and found on the MOHLTC website) includes:
        <br>- A valid driver's license (from any Canadian province/territory).
        <br>- A valid passport (Canadian or from another country).
        <br>- An Ontario Photo Card.
        <br>- A Canadian birth certificate.
        <br>- A Certificate of Canadian Citizenship.
        <br>- An Ontario Health Card (though its number cannot be *recorded* for non-health service purposes, it can be *viewed* for identity verification under NSAA if presented by the patient).
        Other forms may be specified in regulations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_015">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Purposes of the Narcotic Safety and Awareness Act (NSAA)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The NSAA in Ontario was enacted with several key objectives aimed at enhancing public safety regarding "monitored drugs" (which include all opioids, even those not in the CDSA like tramadol). Its main purposes are:
        <br>1. To promote appropriate prescribing and dispensing practices for these drugs.
        <br>2. To identify, reduce, and ultimately prevent the abuse, misuse, and diversion of these potent medications.
        <br>It achieves this through requirements like prescriber and patient identification on prescriptions and dispenser record-keeping of ID, facilitating better monitoring and accountability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_016">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Advertising Narcotics</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Regulations strictly prohibit the advertising of narcotics to the general public. This includes not only direct advertisements of sale but also any actions that could indirectly promote their sale. For instance, narcotics cannot be visibly displayed in the pharmacy where patients might see them; they must be stored out of public sight (e.g., "hidden"). This is to prevent undue inducement or normalization of these potent substances.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_017">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Receiving Verbal Prescriptions for Narcotics/Controlled Drugs</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When a verbal prescription is permissible (e.g., for "Verbal Prescription Narcotics" or certain Controlled Drugs), it can be received by specific registered members of the pharmacy team. This includes a registered pharmacist, a pharmacy intern (acting under appropriate supervision/agreement with preceptor), or a registered pharmacy student acting under the direct supervision of a pharmacist who is physically present. Pharmacy assistants or technicians (unless future regulations change this for specific circumstances) are generally not authorized to independently receive and transcribe new verbal orders for these substances.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_018">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">"Double Doctoring"</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">"Double doctoring" is an offense under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). It occurs when a person, within a 30-day period, seeks or obtains a prescription (an authorization) or the actual substance (from CDSA Schedules I, II, III, or IV) from a practitioner without first disclosing to that practitioner any other prescriptions or authorizations for such substances they have received from any other practitioner(s) within that same 30-day timeframe. The key is the failure to disclose previous acquisitions or authorizations when seeking new ones for these scheduled substances.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_019">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Specific Labeling Requirements for Dispensed Methadone (MMT)</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">In addition to standard prescription labeling requirements under DPRA, methadone dispensed for MMT has specific additional labeling needs due to its nature and risks. These include:
        <br>1. The total dose of methadone in milligrams clearly stated on the bottle.
        <br>2. A prominent warning label, such as "Methadone may cause serious harm to someone other than the intended patient. Not to be used by anyone other than the patient for whom it was intended. MAY BE FATAL TO CHILD OR ADULT."
        Other common requirements include the date for ingestion (for carries), "Keep refrigerated" (if applicable), and "Drink entire contents of bottle" notations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_020">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Verifying Unknown Signatures on Narcotic Prescriptions</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">If a pharmacist receives a written prescription for a narcotic and the prescriber's signature is not known to them, they have a professional and legal obligation to verify its authenticity before dispensing. This is a critical step in preventing the dispensing of forged prescriptions and mitigating the diversion of narcotics. Simply dispensing without verification, especially for an unknown signature, would not meet the standard of practice or the "reasonable steps" required to protect narcotics. Verification might involve contacting the prescriber's office directly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_021">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Ordering Controlled Substances from a Licensed Dealer</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Pharmacists (specifically those authorized as "Narcotic Signers" for the pharmacy) can order controlled substances from licensed dealers through specific, documented methods. A written order, signed by the authorized pharmacist, is a standard method. Orders can also be placed using a computer from a remote input device; however, if this method or a verbal order (for verbal prescription narcotics only) is used, the licensed dealer must receive a written receipt, signed by the pharmacist who received the order, within 5 working days. This receipt confirms the details of the order (name/quantity of drug, date received, pharmacist signature).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_022">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Recording Receipt of Narcotics/Controlled Drugs</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Upon receiving a shipment of narcotics or controlled drugs from a supplier (licensed dealer), the pharmacist must meticulously record specific details in their purchase records (which can be a dedicated register or properly filed invoices). According to Narcotic Control Regulation Section 30, this record must include the name and quantity of the drug received, the date it was received, and the name and address of the supplier. This ensures a clear audit trail for all such substances entering the pharmacy's inventory.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_023">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Narcotics for Prescriber's "Office Use" or "Personal Use"</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">A pharmacist can supply a narcotic to a practitioner for their legitimate office use (e.g., for administration to patients in their practice) or, in very limited and specific circumstances, for the practitioner's own personal medical use if prescribed by another authorized practitioner. When a narcotic is supplied for "office use," it's not dispensed against a typical patient-specific prescription. Instead, it's treated as a sale to the practitioner. This transaction MUST be recorded in the pharmacy's sales report for narcotics, as per Narcotic Control Regulation Section 38 (except for verbal narcotics and propoxyphene, which have different handling). It's not a standard patient dispensing but a documented supply to another healthcare professional.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_024">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Maintaining the Narcotic Prescription File</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Pharmacies are required by Narcotic Control Regulation Section 40 to maintain a special prescription file specifically for narcotic drugs (and often, for practical purposes, controlled drug prescriptions are filed with them for consistency, though the regulation specifically mentions narcotics). This file must be kept for a minimum of two years. A key organizational requirement is that the prescriptions within this file must be maintained in sequence according to their date and prescription number, allowing for orderly retrieval and auditing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_025">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">NSAA Exemptions for Prescribers in Certain Settings</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Narcotic Safety and Awareness Act (NSAA) in Ontario includes provisions that can exempt prescribers working in certain institutional settings from some of its specific requirements (like recording patient ID on the prescription). The text explicitly mentions that prescribers in settings such as hospitals or prisons (correctional facilities) may be exempt from these particular NSAA requirements, recognizing the different operational contexts and existing oversight in these environments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_026">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Dispensing Monitored Drugs (NSAA) Without Patient ID</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The NSAA regulations (Section 7) provide for situations where a patient may not have an approved form of identification when a prescription for a monitored drug is presented. In such cases, exemptions can allow the prescription to be dispensed. However, a critical condition if such an exemption is applied is that only the patient themselves is permitted to pick up or accept a delivery of the medication; an agent cannot act on their behalf in this specific circumstance. This ensures the medication reaches the intended individual when standard ID verification is not possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_027">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Transferring Custody of Methadone Doses</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">When a pharmacy transfers custody of prepared methadone doses to a physician or their delegate at an external treatment location, meticulous documentation is required. The physician or their delegate must sign a patient manifest daily, confirming they have received the correct dose(s) for the correct patient(s). If the doses are not directly handed over, the method of transportation used must be secure and trackable to ensure the safekeeping of the methadone during transit and to account for its custody until it reaches the authorized recipient.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_028">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Methadone: Dose Changes and Returned Unused Doses</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">Any change in a patient's methadone dose for MMT requires a new, valid prescription from the exempted prescriber; pharmacists cannot independently alter doses. If unused, individually labelled methadone doses are returned to the pharmacy from a treatment location (e.g., by the physician or delegate), they must be signed for upon receipt by pharmacy staff. These returned doses must then be entered into the appropriate pharmacy records (e.g., inventory, destruction log) and subsequently destroyed in accordance with all applicable laws, OCP policies, and Health Canada regulations for narcotic destruction. They cannot be re-dispensed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_029">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Emergency Supply of Narcotics Between Pharmacists</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">The Narcotic Control Regulations permit a pharmacist to supply a quantity of a narcotic to another pharmacist for an "emergency purpose." This provision is intended for urgent, unforeseen situations where a pharmacy runs out of a needed narcotic to fill a legitimate patient prescription. The quantity supplied is typically limited to an amount sufficient to fill that one emergency prescription. A critical requirement for this transaction is that the requesting pharmacist must provide a written order, signed and dated, to the supplying pharmacist. This ensures proper documentation for the transfer of the narcotic between the two licensed professionals/pharmacies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-item" data-question-id="jp_b_030">
        <h4 class="feedback-title">Definition and Requirements of a Narcotic/Controlled Drug Prescription</h4>
        <p class="feedback-text">A prescription for a narcotic or controlled drug is legally defined as a direction given by an authorized practitioner for a stated amount of that drug to be dispensed for a specifically named person (the patient). A fundamental requirement is that the quantity of the drug to be dispensed must be clearly stated on the prescription or be easily and unambiguously calculable from the directions for use. For example, "1 tablet three times daily for 7 days" allows calculation (1x3x7=21 tablets). However, directions like "1 tablet three times daily as needed for 7 days" are unacceptable for calculating a definitive quantity for narcotics/controlled drugs because the "as needed" (PRN) nature makes the total amount indeterminate.</p>
    </div>
